**POST** /users/signup
```
{
    "user": {
        "email": "[your-email@email.com]",
        "password": "[your-password]",
        "name": "[your-username]"
    }
}
```

**POST** /users/login
```
{
    "user": {
        "email": "[your-email@email.com]",
        "password": "[your-password]"

}

In the response body you will see you got your **authorization token** that will be needed in every request you make to the available endpoints.
